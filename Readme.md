# Raspberry-Pack

| ![raspberry-pack.png](assets/raspberry-pack.png) | **Why Raspberry-Pack:** Don't flash each Raspberry Pi by hand, but automate things and make it reusable, and all that headlessly: No keyboard, no mouse, no monitor, no ssh needed.<br><br> **Headless, easy, fast and reproducible** |

# What is is good for?

- Raspberry-Packs bundle a specific setup you want to clone/roll out on multiple devices or you want to share with friends or the internet
- It installs packages, runs scripts, setup services on your Raspberry Pi similar to a configured image
- Its aim is to reduce the manual overhead of installing scripts by hand with automation
- Raspberry-Packs can be added from a public git repository (e.g. [example](https://github.com/constant-flow/raspberry-pack-apache2), [all promoted](promoted-packages.md)). These packages will check for updates on every execution of Raspberry-Pack
- Raspberry-Packs can be used locally. Simply create a folder named `raspberry-pack-*` inside the `packages` directory

# Why not using an image

- In contrast to an image, a Raspberry-Pack installs an official distribution image first and based on that the rest
- Every installation step and change is comprehensible upfront, whereas an image is a blackbox where you have no clue what was installed and done. Thus it's modular and developers can copy interesting sections from other Raspberry-Packs
- Images are huge and hard to trim down, Raspberry-Packs are tiny scripts and links to downloads
- Raspberry-Packs are flexible e.g. WiFi or hostname are adjustable via the wizard. Adjusting a Raspberry-Pack is done in a text editor and doesn't require an export.
- At installations it does the updating and upgrading automatically, so you always start with a solid OS

# How to use Raspberry-Pack

Raspberry-Pack is designed for use with [Raspberry Pi](http://www.raspberrypi.org) version 1-4

## The step by step wizard guides you through the installation process

- download raspbian image
- select and configure package
- flash to SD
- boot your RPi
- informs you when the install is done
- helps how to connect to it via ssh (not required)

## Getting started

```
# clone the project
git clone git@github.com:constant-flow/raspberry-pack.git

# install Raspberry-Pack tool
pip install -r requirements.txt

# run Raspberry-Pack wizard
python wizard.py
```

> **Raspberry-Pack relies on [Python 3](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/), try using `pip3` and `python3` when encountering issues**
>
> **MAC/OSX supported only (No Windows or Linux support)**

## Create your own Raspberry-Pack

Create a folder inside `packages/`. Each package name has the prefix `raspberry-pack-`.

| Filename                   | required | where / when      | use                                                                                                               |

| `ðŸ“¦/autologin.conf`        |          | RPi / first boot  | when this file exists, the system will login automatically (CLI/GUI)                                              |
| `ðŸ“¦/no-update.conf`        |          | RPi / first boot  | when this file exists, the system will not update system packages (only use during development)                   |
| `ðŸ“¦/update-only.conf`      |          | RPi / first boot  | when this file exists, the system will only update system packages                                                |
| `ðŸ“¦/enable-vnc.conf`       |          | RPi / first boot  | when this file exists, the system will be connectable via VNC (virtual Network Computing)                         |
| `ðŸ“¦/keep-gui-wizard.conf`  |          | RPi / first boot  | when this file exists, the system will keep the Raspberry GUI wizard on startup                                   |
| `ðŸ“¦/run-on-boot.sh`        |          | RPi / first boot  | script to run after updating and installing apt packages                                                          |
| `ðŸ“¦/run-after-boot.sh`     |          | RPi / second boot | script to run after the "installation done"-signal. Useful, when connection will drop                             |
| `ðŸ“¦/run-on-gui-boot.sh`    |          | RPi / gui boot    | script to run after the the first time when the Raspberry boots to the graphical interface (used for GUI OS only) |
| `ðŸ“¦/service-starter.sh`    |          | RPi / every boot  | when this file exists, this script is called via a service at every boot of the Raspberry                         |
| `ðŸ“¦/*`                     |          | RPi / any script  | add all your files you need for your script in here. In your script you can access it here `/boot/ðŸ“¦/*`           |

> ðŸ“¦ = `raspberry-pack`
>
> If you don't need a certain `\*.conf` or `*.sh` file, better delete it, than leaving it empty. Keep things tidy.
>
> Take care your script doesn't need user interaction, use command parameters, piping and other tricks to achieve required inputs
