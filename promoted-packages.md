# Packages to add from git repositories

When selecting a Raspberry-Pack in the wizard, the last option is to add a new repository. This is a list of known official and user's packages that are publicly available.

**TIP:** We suggest to use the SSH uri as this should allow you to also use private remote repositories as a source for your packages.
